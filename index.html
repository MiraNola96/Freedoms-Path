    <h1>Campaign</h1>
     <p>Welcome to “Break the Silence” a Warriors and Quiet Waters Campaign. The goal of this campaign is to reach out to all Veterans who may be struggling with mental health disorders. We believe that every veteran deserves the opportunity to take a journey of renewal to help them find the resiliency that they need to navigate the journey toward mental wellness.
      <br><br>
      Our mission is simple yet profound: to provide a resource so that veterans can find solace, strength, and support in their everyday lives. Through Warriors & Quiet Waters therapeutic outdoor experiences connected with, peer camaraderie, and holistic wellness initiatives, we empower veterans to reclaim their sense of purpose and rediscover the freedom to live life to the fullest, giving Veterans a renewed sense of purpose.
      <br><br>
      Take the first step in “Breaking Your Silence” today, and together, let's pave the way to a future filled with hope, healing, and boundless possibilities.

      <h1>Common signs of a struggling Veteran:</h1>
      <p>When veterans return from active duty, alcohol and other drugs may be used as a form of self-medication. Self-medication is often used to cope with feelings of stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, and other mental health conditions. The psychological effects of military service can feel unmanageable, and turning to substances may feel like the managing of symptoms.
      <br><br>
      Alcohol and other drugs provide veterans with temporary relief from symptoms they may be experiencing. However, increased levels of substance use can ultimately lead to consequences in the long term.</p>

    <h1>Why don't Veterans seek mental health?</h1>
     <p>They may be afraid of being labeled as weak or defective, and they may worry that others will judge them harshly or look down on them. This stigma can lead to feelings of shame and isolation, preventing veterans from getting the support they need to manage their symptoms and cope with their experiences.
    <br><br>
    44% to 72% of Veterans experience high levels of stress and anxiety during their transition from Military to Civilian life.
